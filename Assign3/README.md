# About

built a math library in haskell to help me with my calculus homework. Created an expression datatype which can fully evaluate an expression, perform partial differentiation, simplification of expressions, and can parse strings into an expression datatype. 
## Citing

my calc library was created with references including:
```
Curtis' code 
```

# Challenges 
The main chalenges where implementing extra features into the Haskell math library. 

# How I overcame
I used extra features such as :

1. implemented the calculation of derivatives 
3. trig funtions and other useful function eg.. Subtract, to the power of ...
2. implemented integrals
3. surface area of revolution about y
4. surface area of revolution about x

# Utitity 
run on any terminal
